      specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of
      the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
      Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and
      store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website
      and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you
      from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing
      partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information,
      but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on
      the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory
      are welcome to contact us.

    <h2 class="font-semibold">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
    <p>
      In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a
      legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal

      not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of

      purposes:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
      <li>Send administrative information</li>
      <li>Request user feedback</li>
      <li>Improve user experience</li>
      <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the
      Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the
      following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more
      specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing
      of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or
      European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary
      for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
      pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for
      compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv)
      processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest
      or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is
      necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by
      a third party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information
      until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to
      rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any
      case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
      the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
      Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
      necessary to enter into a contract.
